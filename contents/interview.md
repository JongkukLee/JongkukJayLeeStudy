## Tell me about yourself. ##
>Thank you for giving me this opportunity. My name is Jongkuk Lee, but you can also call me Jay. I am from South Korea. I worked as Java web programmer in Korea for over 10 years. I learned many programming skills and company culture from my previous company. But I wanted another opportunity to improve myself and working in Canada was my dream. So, I quit my job in 2015. I studied English and completed the Computer Programming Developer Program at Seneca College.

## What do you consider to be your major strengths? ##
>My greatest strength is my “can-do attitude”. My life motto is to not sweat the small stuff. I tend not to worry too much and usually enjoy physical exercise such as swimming. Through my previous working experience, I could learn that being healthy helps me concentrate better and work longer hours without feeling tired. It also gives me the positive mind.

## What would you say your biggest weakness is? ##
>My weak point is that I try to do too many things at once. These days, I’ve been prioritizing my work in order of importance. This is because I want to fully complete a task before moving on to another. It has proven to be an efficient strategy for me.

## Why did you choose your major? ##
### What is your major and why did you choose that major? ###
### How has your college experience prepared you for your career? ###
>My college experience has complemented my professional experience in the field. As I mentioned, I worked as Java web programmer in Korea for over 10 years but my experience at Seneca College has helped me transfer my skills and break into the computer programming industry in Canada. I studied C and C++, NodeJS, Angular as well as Java 8 version. And I got a GPA average of 3.9 out of 4. I was able to develop new skills and experiences from my courses and also I got the confidence and new knowledge from my major in college.

## Where do you see yourself in five years? ##
### What are your long-term goals? ###
>My short-term goal is rapidly adapting to my company, and through improving my English communication skill, I would like to communicate with my co-workers more effectively. My long-term goal is growing with a company. And once I gain more experience, I’d like to move on from a developer to technical management position.

## Do you prefer working alone or in a team? ##
### Do you prefer to work alone or with others? ###
### Do you work more effectively on alone or in a group situation? ###
>I believe that both are equally important, so I like to work in an environment where there is a combination of both. It’s important to work in teams because we can share ideas and learn from each other. But it’s also great to work at my own pace. Actually, in my experience, I participated in the meeting at day, and I coded at night.

## What is your ideal work environment? ##
### What do you consider important when looking for a job? ###
>My ideal work environment would be one in which there is respect for individuals’ ideas and appreciation for good job. I would like to belong to a workplace that gives enough space and helps employees grow. Also, there should be healthy team work, good communication, and a common vision that is shared by everyone. Such a working environment is my ideal workplace.

## How do you handle stress and pressure? ##
### Do you work well under stress/pressure? ###
>In my case, exercise is a great stress solution. I manage stress by visiting the gym several times a week. Also, I’m the kind of person who stays calm under pressure and handles stress fairly easily. I prioritize my responsibilities so I have a clear idea of what needs to be done now. This has helped me effectively manage pressure as a student or as an employee. 

## Tell me about your work experience. ##
### Where did you work? ###
### What did you do in your previous company? ###
>I worked as Java web developer in Korea for over 10 years. I could improve the developing skills with Java language and understand a database system from several projects. When it comes to talking about my most career, in 2004, I participated in POSCO performance innovation project. POSCO is one of largest steel makers in the world. It has over hundred factories and over 10,000 employees working in there. This project used Java component-based development (CBD) architecture. In this project, I analyzed the business process and developed systems for a few factories using Java business components. I believe that this project has contributed to improving the business processes of customer’s company with managing products from planning to shipping. Because of my work, I was selected as a POSCO system maintenance team member providing IT service to customers. In the maintenance team, my main duties were analyzing the customer’s requests and developing, deploying them to the existing running system without any impacts. That was my general tasks in the maintenance team. However, if one maintenance estimated budget was more than $300,000, the maintenance service became a unit project. Then I had to work double jobs as a maintenance team member as well as the project team member. I operated the system for 5 factories in Korea and the system of 1 factory in Indonesia until 2015.

### What knowledge or specialty do you have? ###
>I worked as Java Web programmer in Korea for over 10 years. Since I’ve spent many years in a Web developing company, my expertise is focused on Web developing skills using Java language and database systems. When I worked in the POSCO system maintenance team, Oracle was (and still is) the biggest IT partner of POSCO, so POSCO chose many Oracle products for their system such as database system, business component solution, application server and so on. I learned the technical skills from my previous work. As well, I also learned a sense of responsibility for the system, and I had the idea to meet deadlines for developing software. Moreover, the most important thing that I learned from my previous work is the sense of organization. POSCO is the big size company, so there are many system technical supporting teams such as the system architecture team, the quality assurance team, and global standardization team and so on. I had to corporate with those teams and follow the company standardization. Through those experiences, I was able to understand the company culture and understand that the company’s goal should be more prioritized than individual’s one. 

### What is your motto? ##
>My life motto is not to sweat the small stuff. If I do my best, then I tend not to worry too much. A good result should follow me. ‘Just do it.’ is one of my favorite expressions. It’s better to try something rather than just worrying about it.

### Who is your role model? ##
>My father is my role model. In Korea, usually fathers take responsibility for their family finance. That is why Korean fathers are more faithful to their companies.
