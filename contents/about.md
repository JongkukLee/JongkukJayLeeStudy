# Overview

This website introdues the methodology of ["CBD(Component Based Development)"](http://) project giving [POSCO]() [MES (Manufacturing Execution System)]().<br />

>[POSCO]() is the the world's fourth-largest steelmaker by this measure in 2015. As steel-making is the most process industory, there is pursuited non-stop system from plan to delivery.<br />

>[MES (Manufacturing Execution System)]() is the management system of the produce activity management system on real-time from determining the optimized job-order to garunteeing the quality assurance.
There was POSCO project Between 2002 and 2004 with nearly 300 million dolar IT buget.<br />

This project had certain goals: <br />
The **first** is to building the system in comstomer perspective through data syscronization between MES (Manufacturing Execution System) and ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning).<br />
The **second** is the integration all branches plants including the global manufactures.<br />
The **third part** is to reduce mantainance costs through converting COBOL system to JAVA-oriented system.<br />

In IT prospective,
- Unifying the businesss rules through managing master data
- Systemmatically managing the messages among heterogenous systems such as Enterprise Resource Planning sysems, Manufacturing Systems, Process computers using EAI (Enterpris Application Integration) system
- Reducing the maintainance cost using reuse components<br />

Where are the goals, and especially 'Reuse Component' was the keyword in applying Component-Based-Development methodology in this project.<br />

So, **what is the development to apply "CBD(Component Based Development)"?**<br />
CBD is to reuse the existing components to develop applications, whose the benefits include:
- Enhance the quality from the components already proved the perfomane and stablity
- Cost down for maintance through replacing and extending only components
- Improve the productivity via reusing components<br />

This website is, as you can see the title, the objective to introduce how to create and how to utilize the reuse components.
In end-up, this will implement the simple manufacturing project.<br />
