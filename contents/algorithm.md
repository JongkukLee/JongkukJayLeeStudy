> In computer science, algorithm is "an unambiguous specification to solve problems" ([WIKIPIDIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm)), 
Also, data structure is an abstracted data type (ADT) to handle a algorithmatic way of data such as array, stack, and queue.<br />

## Euclidean algorithm ##
Euclidean algorithm is a way to find the **greatest common divisor** of two positive integers.

Here is a function gcd `int gcd(int u, int v)`, which receive two integers 'u' and 'v' as the passed parameters and return type also integer. if u value is greater than 0, then the while statement is looping. Inside the while statement, if v is greater than u, then exchange u and v; in this case, t is the temporary variable for exchange u and v; otherwise, u is assigned the value of u minus v. If u becomes 0, then the while statement is finished, and finally return v as greatest common divisor.

```java
int gcd(int u, int v) 
{

    int t; // the temporary variable for exchange u and v

    while (u > 0) // loop while u is greater than 0 
    { 
        if (u < v) // if u is greater than v,   
        { 
            t = u; u = v; v = t; // exchange u and v
        }
        // otherwise, u assigns u minus v 
        u = u â€“ v;
    }
    // if u is 0, escape the loop, and return v value as greatest common divisor.  
    return v;
}
```
For example, give u is 4, and v is 2. First, ask if u is greater than 0, true because now u is 4, v is 2. Next, v is greater than u, false. So, u is assignee  4 - 2, and v is still 2. In next while loop, ask if u is greater than 0, true because now u is 2, v is 2. Next, v is greater than u, false. So, u is assigned 2 - 2, and v is still 2. In next while loop, ask if u is greater than 0, false. So cursor is move to return statement, and return value is 2. Therefore the greatest common divisor is 2.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|u=4,v=2<br>if u>0, true|if u<v, false|u=4-2|u=2,v=2<br>if u>0, true|if u<v, false|u=2-2|u=0,v=2<br>if u>0, false|return 2|

But, when the gap between u and v is big, it requires many loop for operating minus between u and v. 
So, what is the advance way? <br />

The answer is using remainder operation.<br />

In the same function gcd `int gcd(int u, int v)`, if v value is greater than 0, then the while statement is looping. Inside the while statement, u is assigned v and v is assigned the value of u remainder v, t is the temporary variable to store the remainder vlaue. If v becomes 0, then the while statement is finished, and finally return u as greatest common divisor.

```java
int gcd (int u, int v) 
{
    int t; // the temporary variable for exchange u and v
    while (v > 0) // loop while v is greater than 0  
    { 
        t = u % v;
        u = v; // u is assigned v 
        v = t; // v is assigned the value of u remainder v
    }
    // if v is 0, escape the loop, and return u value as greatest common divisor.    
    return u;
}
```

For example, give u is 4, and v is 2. First, ask if v is greater than 0, true because now u is 4, v is 2. So, u is 2, and v is assignee  4 % 2 . In next while loop, ask if v is greater than 0, false because now u is 2, v is 0. So cursor is move to return statement, and return value is 2. Therefore the greatest common divisor is 2.

|---|---|---|---|
|u=4,v=2<br>if v>0, true|v=4%2|u=2,v=0<br>if v>0, false|return 2|

Table1 shows how many steps there are in two GCM algorithm. When using minus (-) operation, the 15 steps are needed, while when using remainder (%) operation, only 4 steps are needed. In first way, the larger the gap between two parameters is, the more steps it needs.    

### Using Minus VS Modulo operator ###

|Step|Using minus (-) operator|Using modulo (%) operator|
|---|---          |---         |
|1  |  GCD(280,30)|GCD(280, 30)| 
|2  |= GCD(250,30)|= GCD(30,10)|
|3  |= GCD(220,30)|= GCD(10,0) |
|4  |= GCD(190,30)|= 10|
|5  |= GCD(160,30)||
|6  |= GCD(130,30)||
|7  |= GCD(100,30)||
|8  |= GCD(70, 30)||
|9  |= GCD(40, 30)||
|10 |= GCD(10, 30)||
|11 |= GCD(30, 10)||
|12 |= GCD(20, 10)||
|13 |= GCD(10, 10)||
|14 |= GCD(0,  10)||
|15 |= 10||

Now, the other way will be introduced, which is using recusive function. Recusive function is calling function itself. Recusive function has two conditions; one is that it must have the end point; the sencond is that the problem must be reduced.<br />

Here is a function gcd_recustion `int gcd_recursion(int u, int v)`, which receive two integers 'u' and 'v' as the passed parameters and return type also integer. In line 6th, v value is continuously reduced by asigning u % v, and once it will be 0, then return u as greatest common divisor; otherwise, the recusive function will call the function itself until v becomes 0.<br /> 

```java
int gcd_recursion(int u, int v) 
{
    if (v == 0) // it is the stop pointer 
        return u;
    else
        return gcd_recursion(v, u%v);
}
```
### Figure1. GCD recusive funtion in tree structure ###

>**Note that the recusive function can provide more conprehensive source code; however, it uses more cost to call function.**  

Let's move to next topic, array.

## Array ##
Array is a data collection in same type, for example, int, float, double, char, which uses contiguous storage in a memory, and it has the fixed size, and it can approach to the memory with index (0, 1, 2, ..., n).<br />
Now I am talking aobut how to project mulit-dimensions array like one-dimension array? 
<br />
We can write an array with three rows and three columns. It can be written: 
<br />
```
int array [3][3] = {
    { 1, 2, 3 },
    { 4, 5, 6 },
    { 7, 8, 9 }
};
```
or, it can be used like one-dimension array:
```
int array[3][3] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 };
```
<br />
Each elments of this array are contiguously stored in memory:
<br />
![Image]({{ site.globalurl }}/contents/img/array1.jpg)
<br />
The index 0 to 2 is the first row or first-dimension, the index 3 to 5 is the second row, and the index 6 to 8 is third row.<br />

Here there are two ways to approach the element of two-dimensions array.

In first source code snipet, we can access each element with row and column. It is very normal way.

```java
int average(int m[][], int n1, int n2) 
{
    int i, j;
    int sum = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < n1; i++)
        for (j = 0; j < n2; j++)
            sum += m[i][j]; // consider this part
    return sum/(3 * 3);
}
int array[3][3];
int average = average(array, 3, 3);
```

However, we can also access two-dimensions array like one-dimentsion array. Note the line 7 `sum += m[i * n2 + j];` of the second source code snipet.

```java
int average(int m[][], int n1, int n2) 
{
    int i, j;
    int sum = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < n1; i++)
        for (j = 0; j < n2; j++)
            sum += m[i * n2 + j]; // consider this part
    return sum/(n1 * n2);
}
int array[3][3];
int average = average(array, 3, 3);
```

Multi-demensions array also has same way; the way of accessing multi-dimensions array,

```java
int tri[3][4][2];
int func(int t[][4][2], int n1, int n2, int n3) 
{
    // .....
    sum += m[i][j][k]; // consider this part    
}
r = func(tri);
```

and the way of accessing one-dimension array.

```java
int tri[3][4][2];
int func(int m[][][], int n1, int n2, int n3) 
{
    // .....
    sum += m[i * n2 * n3 + j * n3 + k];  // consider this part
}
r = func(tri, 3, 4, 2);
```

## Linked List ##
The linked list is the data structure that is stored non-contiguous storage in memory, has variable size, access the random pointer, can **reverse iteration**.<br />
The member variables of linked list are a data and a link that points to next node.<br />

Figure1 shows the arrangement of the linked list in memory and the conceptional arragement of it.<br />

### Figure1. Physical and Logical concept of linked list ###

![Image]({{ site.globalurl }}/contents/img/linkedlist1.jpg)

Physically, there are not contiguous in the memory. In physical concept of lisked list, each node is located in different memory area. However, in logical concept of linked list, the start node refers to 'L' node, 'L' refers to 'I', and 'I' refers to 'N' and so on. all elements are connected in order. So, it has more advantage in a inserting operation than in a searching operation. 

### simple linked list ###
The simple linked list is one way linked list, which has data and next pointer. The operations are initialization, destruction, insertNext, deleteNext, and iteration & retrieval. <br />

Simple list skeleton uses a class template, node struct to represent the node, includes the constructor, insert, and delete operation. <br />

|---|---|
|**In constructor**, the head node and tail node are created, <br />and initialized by connecting with each other. The next ponter of the head node <br />refers to the address of the tail node, and the next pointer of the tail node refers to the tail node itself.|![Image]({{ site.globalurl }}/contents/img/simplelinkedlist1.jpg)|

Let's insert new node.

**Insert function** receives the information of current node, and a new node will be inserted after the current node. The next pointer of new node is assigned the next pointer of current node. That is the address of the next node. The next pointer of current node refers to the address of new node. Now, the new node is inserted. <br />
![Image]({{ site.globalurl }}/contents/img/simplelinkedlist2.jpg)

To delete a node, 

|---|---|
|**delete function** receives the information of current node, <br />and the node after the current node will be deleted. <br />The next pointer of current node refers to the next pointer <br />of deleted node. That is the address of the next node. The next pointer of deleted ndoe will be disconnected. Now the deleted node has nothing connection with any node|![Image]({{ site.globalurl }}/contents/img/simplelinkedlist3.jpg)|

So far, we see about simple linked list. From now on, we will see double linked list.

## Doubly Linked List ##

Doubly linked list is two way linked list, and each node has two fields for refering to the address of the previous and the next node. As operation, there are initialization, destruction, insertNext, insertBefore, deleteAt, iteration & retrieval.<br />

|---|---|
|**In constructor**, the head node and tail node are created, <br />and the previous pointer of head node refers to head node itself, the next pointer refers <br />to the address of tail node. The previous pointer of tail node refers <br />to the address of head node, and the next pointer refers to the tail node itself.|![Image]({{ site.globalurl }}/contents/img/doublelinkedlist1.jpg)| 

InsertNext function is very similar to the simple linked list, which receives the information of current node, and a new node will be inserted after the current node. The next pointer of new node assigns to the next pointer of current node. That is the address of the next node. The next pointer of current node refers to the address of new node. <br />

![Image]({{ site.globalurl }}/contents/img/doublelinkedlist3.jpg)

InsertBefore function receives the information of current node, and a new node will be inserted before the current node. The previous pointer of new node assigns the prevous pointer of current node. That is the address of the previous node. The previous of current node refers to the address of new node. <br />

![Image]({{ site.globalurl }}/contents/img/doublelinkedlist2.jpg)

Next is the delete function.

|---|---|
|**Delete function** receives the information of  current node, <br />and a new node after the current node will be deleted. The <br />next pointer of current node refers to the next pointer of <br />deleted node. That is the address of next node. The previous <br />pointer of the pointer of the deleted node refers to the <br />previous pointer of the deleted node. That is the address of the previous node. The previous and next pointer of current node are disconnected.|![Image]({{ site.globalurl }}/contents/img/doublelinkedlist4.jpg)|

That's it for all inserting and deleting node in double-linked list. Next, we are talking about stack and queue.

## Stack ##

>Stack is a data structure with the same entrance and exit, and block the bottom. Stack is "LAST IN-FIRST OUT", called 'LIFO', which means that the fisrt input data will be poped in the last order. The operations are push and pop functions. <br />

Figure stack.1 shows the conception of the Stack data structure and algorithm. In most left figure, there are five elements, and the cursor indicates the most top position. When 'PUSH X' occurs, the 'X' must be located on the most top, and cursor will indicate to new top position. When poping from a stack, the element of the most top must be poped, and the cursor will indicate new top position.    
### Figure stack1. the Conception of Stack ###
![Image]({{ site.globalurl }}/contents/img/stack1.jpg)

To implement stack, there are a using array stack and list stack. The skeletone of array stack includes an exceptions, its constructor/destructor, helper functions, push/pop/getTop/removeAll functions, and some fields are needed to store data, to represent the insert/delete positions, and to represent the size of array. Also, the skeletone of list stack includes exceptions, its  constructor/destructor, helper functions, push/pop/getTop/removeAll functions, and a field is needed to store data.<br />
Note that actually a simple linked list is a stack itself!<br />

## Queue ##

>Queue is a data structure, which has different positions in entrance and exit, and open both entrance and exit. Queue is "FIRST IN FIRST OUT" (FIFO), which mean that the fisrt put data will be gotten in the first. The operations are put and get functions.

Figure queue.1 shows the conception of the Queue data structure and algorithm. In most left figure, there are five elements, and the front indicates the exit posision, and the rear indicates the entrance position. When getting from a queue, the element of the front must be gotten, and the front pointer will indicate new front position. When 'PUT X' occurs, the 'X' must be located on the rear position, and rear will indicate to new entrance point.

### Figure queue1. the Conception of Queue ###
![Image]({{ site.globalurl }}/contents/img/queue2.jpg)

To implement queque, there are a using array queue and list queue. In terms of array queue, we have to use circular queue. Why is the circular queue is needed? Figure queue2 and Figure queue3 show how to operate in general style queue and circular queue respectively. While putting and getting elements in array queue, the position of the front and rear will go to the end of array. But, the array has the fixed size for saving elements, so we can't use the index beyond the size of array. Therefore, whenever it arrives at the end of array, we have to copy all elements to the beginning of the array; on the other hand, the circular queue do not need to copy.<br />

### Figure queue2. General Queue operation ###
![Image]({{ site.globalurl }}/contents/img/queue3.jpg)

In figure queue3, the front indicates the point to get the element from the queue, and the rear indicates the point to put new element into the queue. 

### Figure queue3. Circular Queue operation ###
![Image]({{ site.globalurl }}/contents/img/queue1.jpg)

When the 'the front' and 'the rear' refer to the same index of circluar array, we call it **'Empty condition'**, and whenever an element is put to circluar array queue, the rear refers to the next index. If the rear indicates the right before the front, we call it **Full condition**. In the full conditon, if new element is tried to put, then an exception must be happened.<br />

The skeletone of circular queue includes an exceptions, its constructor/destructor, helper functions, put/get/increase/decrease functions, and some fields are needed to store data, to represent the number of data, and to represent the size of array. Also, the skeletone of ListQueue includes exceptions, its constructor/destructor, helper functions, put/get functions, and a field is needed to store data.<br />

[DSA555](https://cathyatseneca.gitbooks.io/data-structures-and-algorithms/content/)

Next, we are talking about **'Notation'**.

## Notation ##
In data structure and algorithm, there are three kinds of notation: prefix notation, infix notation, and postfix notation. Prefix notation is that there is an operator before two operands (+ A B). Infix notation is that there is an operator between two operands (ex: A + B), and postfix notation is that there is operator after two operands (A B +). <br />

In human being perspective, infix notation is easy to calulate, but in computer, postifx notaion is calculated easier than infix one. So, now we will see how to change infix notation to postfix notation,

### Post notation ###
To change infix notation to postfix notation, 

1. Determine the precedence of operator: '(' : 0, '+' and '-': 1, '*' and '/' : 2
2. If meeting '(', push it into the stack
3. If meeting ')', pop elements and add them to the result until meeting '(', and throw away '(' and ')'.
4. If meeting operator, pop the elements and add them to the result until meeting upper level operator than itself, and push itself.
5. If meeting operand, add operand to the result.
6. When all input is complete, pop the rest all operators and add them to the result.

When we change the (2*(3+6/2)+2)/4+3, the result is 2362/+*2+4/3+.

<!--![Image]({{ site.globalurl }}/contents/img/postfix1.jpg)-->

And in this time, we will see how to calculate postfix notaion in computer.

To calculate the postfix notation, 
1. If meeting operand, push the operand into the stack.
2. If meeting operator, pop an operand from the stack, put it on the right of the operator, and pop it again from the stack, and put it on the left of the operator. Calulate them, and push only result into stack, and throw away the operator and the poped two operands.
3. The last one left in stack is the final result.
<!-- ![Image]({{ site.globalurl }}/contents/img/postfix2.jpg) -->

## Tree ##

> Tree is a nonlinear data structure, which is consisted of node (vertex) and link (edge). Node has data, and linke represents the relationship between two nodes. Tree has at least a root, which is the top level node. All nodes have a parent node except root, but node can have serveral children node. The path from a node to other is unique.

![Image]({{ site.globalurl }}/contents/img/tree12.jpg)

Especially, the binary tree is the most useful and is utilized at many parts. So, now we will see about the binary tree.

### Binary Tree ###

> Binary tree is a tree data structure that all nodes have maximum two nodes: left child and right child. **Parse three** is used to calculate, **heap tree** is used to sort, and **binary search tree** is for searching.<br />

Another categorization is: 

|Complete Binary Tree|Perfect Binary Tree|
|---|---|
|all level node is filled with <br />except the last node, and last <br />nodes are left node.|all level nodes are filled with|
|![Image]({{ site.globalurl }}/contents/img/binary1.jpg)|![Image]({{ site.globalurl }}/contents/img/binary2.jpg)|

There are two way to create binary tree: array tree and linked list tree. Array can be used in only complete binary tree case and is used heap sort algorithm. <br />

|---|---|
|To intialize the tree structure, we may use the start node <br />and the end node to use nodes between the start and end nodes with <br />the same logic.|![Image]({{ site.globalurl }}/contents/img/tree1.jpg)|

The root node is the left of the start node. All leaf nodes refer to the end node. Binary tree skeleton has node struct, start / end node, constructor / desctructor, removeAll function.
![Image]({{ site.globalurl }}/contents/img/tree2.jpg)
 
To visit all nodes, **tree traversal** is used, which are stack-based and queque-based traversal. Stack-based traversal has **'pre-order'**, **'post-order'**, and **'in-order'**, and queue-based traversal has '**level-order**'. 

Let's move to inplemenation of traversal. To visit all of nodes of the below tree,
![Image]({{ site.globalurl }}/contents/img/tree3.jpg)

|pre-order|in-order|post-order|level-order|
|1. visit to root, 2. visit to left subtree, 3. visit to right subtree.|1. visit to left subtree, 2. visit to root, 3. visit to right subtree.|1. visit to left subtree, 2. visit to right subtree, 3. visit to root|level-order traversal is to visit from top to bottom, and frm left to right.|
|![Image]({{ site.globalurl }}/contents/img/tree4.jpg)|![Image]({{ site.globalurl }}/contents/img/tree5.jpg)|![Image]({{ site.globalurl }}/contents/img/tree6.jpg)||
|A->B->D->G->H->E->C->F->I|G->D->H->B->E->A->C->I->F|G->H->D->E->B->I->F->C->A|A->B->C->D->E->F->G->H->I|

Generally, in pre-order traversal, recusive can be converted non-converted way using stack.

```cpp
void BinaryTree::PreOrderTraverse_Stack(Node *pNode) 
{
    ListStack<Node*> stack;
    stack.Push(pNode);
    while (!stack.IsEmpty()) 
    {
        pNode = stack.Pop();
        if (pNode != m_pNodeTail) 
        {
            Visit(pNode);
            stack.Push(pNode->pRight);
            stack.Push(pNode->pLeft);
        }
    }
}
```
Level-order traversal shows how to visit all node with queue.

```cpp
void BinaryTree::LevelOrderTraverse(Node *pNode) 
{
    ListQueue<Node*> queue;
    queue.Put(pNode);
    while (!queue.IsEmpty()) 
    {
        pNode = queue.Get();
        if (pNode != m_pNodeTail) 
        {
            Visit(pNode);
            queue.Put(pNode->pLeft);
            queue.Put(pNode->pRight);
        }
    }
}
```
Now, you can demonstrate algotrithm of pre-order traversal and level-order traversal with stack and queue respectively.

|pre-order|level-order|

### Parse Tree ###
Parse tree is to consist a tree according to operation precedence. Operator is located in root, and operand is located on child. All operator is **non terminal**, and Operand is **terminal node**.

How do you make parse tree using post notation?

To make parse, first create operand node, and push it to stack. Also, create operator node. After that, pop a node from stack, and make it as right child, and pop another node from stack, and make it as left child. Loop from 1 and 2. The last node of stack becomes root.

```cpp
//1. push operand node to stack
//2. create operator node
//    1. pop a node from stack, and make it as right child
//    2. pop another node from stack, and make it as left child
//    3. push operator Node to stack
//3. the last node of stack is root

void ParseTree::BuildParseTree(const String& strPostfix) 
{
    Node *pNode;
    int i = 0;
    ListStack<Node*> NodeStack;
    RemoveAll();
    while (strPostfix[i]) {
        while (strPostfix[i] == ' ')
            i++; // ignore space
        
        pNode = new Node;

        if (IsOperator(strPostfix[i])) 
        {
            pNode->data = strPostfix[i];
            i++;
            pNode->pRight = NodeStack.Pop();
            pNode->pLeft = NodeStack.Pop();
        }
        else 
        {
            do {
                pNode->data += strPostfix[i];
                i++;
            } while (strPostfix[i] != ' ' &&
                i < strPostfix.GetLength());
            
            pNode->pLeft = m_pNodeTail;
            pNode->pRight = m_pNodeTail;
        }
        NodeStack.Push(pNode);
    }
    m_pNodeHead->pLeft = NodeStack.Pop();
}
```
Through the above logic, fomular ((A+B)*(C-D))/E+(F*G) will become the below parse three.

![Image]({{ site.globalurl }}/contents/img/tree9.jpg)

Let's demonstrate how the parse tree is created in stack.

|---|---|
|![Image]({{ site.globalurl }}/contents/img/tree10.jpg)|![Image]({{ site.globalurl }}/contents/img/tree11.jpg)|

Note that in parse tree:
1. in-order traverse can illustrate infix notaion.
2. pre-order traverse can illustrate prefix notation.
3. post-order traverse can inllustrate postfix notation.

## Recursion ##

Recursive Function calls itself and there are divide and conquer strategy in it. . One example is tree traversal.

```cpp
void BinaryTree::PreOrderTraverse(Node *pNode) 
{
    if (pNode != m_pNodeTail) 
    {
        Visit(pNode);
        PreOrderTraverse(pNode->pLeft);
        PreOrderTraverse(pNode->pRight);
    }
}
```

Recusive function has to meet two needs: the problem becomes smaller and there is the exit condition. In factorial algorithm, line `if (n == 0)` is the exit condition, and line `n * factorial(n â€“ 1)` makes the size of theproblem smaller.

```cpp
int factorial (int n) 
{
    if (n == 0) // exit condition
        return 1;
    else
        return n * factorial(n â€“ 1); // the problem size become smaller
}
```

### Fibonacci ###
Fibonacci sequence is the series of the numbers, which defines that **"every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, .."** ([WIKIPIDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)).
<br /><br />
The relation can be defined: F<sub>n</sub> = F<sub>n-1</sub> + F<sub>n-2</sub>, F<sub>1</sub> = F<sub>2</sub> =0
<br />

The source code example of fibonacci is :
```cpp
int fibonacci(int n) 
{
    if (n == 1 || n == 2)
        return 1;
    else
        return fibonacci(n â€“ 1) + fibonacci(n â€“ 2);
}
```

Figure recusive 1 shows how it can be demonstrated in a parse tree structure. To find the number of sequence 5th in fibonacci, input the value of 5 in ``int fibonacci(n)``. So, it calls ``fibonacci(5)``, and ``fibonacci(5)`` has two leaf nodes: ``fibonacci(4)`` and ``fibonacci(3)``. ``fibonacci(4)`` also has two leaf nodes: ``fibonacci(3)`` and ``fibonacci(2)``. Since we already deinfine the value of ``fibonacci(1)`` and ``fibonacci(2)`` as **'1'**, when adding all return values, the result is **'5'**.

Consider how we can write fibonacci as non-recusive function.
```cpp
int fibonacci_nr(int n) 
{
    int r = 0;
    int a = 1;
    int b = 1;
    if (n == 1 || n == 2)
        return 1;
    while (n-- > 2) 
    {
        r = a + b;
        a = b;
        b = r;
    }
    return r;
}
```
This table shows the operating step of the above source code.
